mate-app
========

An app for managing several beverage crates (initially just Club Mate). See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club-Mate) for more information about Club-Mate.

At my workplace, coffe is not to everybody's taste. One of my colleagues bought a crate of Club Mate and pinned a tally above it to the wall. Every employee and our student employees who want to drink a bottle have to mark it on the list.
Because of the unsteady work times/days of our student employees and their chronic shortage of money, collecting debts was pain in the a**. So I made this app. Now we have a beverage cash box, buy the crates pre paid and manage deposits and purchases with this app with minimal effort.

### how to use

After you first logged in to the app, you have been granted some basic admin rights and can grant you the rest of rights after this you can e.g. modify pages, write news and create beverage-crates.

The continuous texts in news and pages can be written in markdown.

Improvements are welcome!
